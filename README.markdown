WiFi Reconnector
=================

Keep losing your internet connection, but your wifi is still connected? Does turning your wifi adapter off and on fix the problem, but you're tired of manually turning it off and on every 5 minutes? 

Automate!

*Usage:*
Run `ruby lib/wifi.rb` from terminal, or execute `bin/wifi` from finder.

_This is a fork of Kevin Griffin's WiFi Reconnector, but with growl support stripped for easy executing without dependencies._
